In the rapidly expanding field of solar energy, finding comprehensive national-scale photovoltaic (PV) datasets can be challenging. Resources are often scattered across multiple websites and APIs, with significant variations in quality and accessibility. This repository aims to streamline access to these datasets by centralizing their where abouts into one location, thereby supporting research and enabling the development of solar energy forecasting models across new and existing markets.

## Countries Overview

All country-specific data can be found in the [`countries`](./countries) folder. Inside, you‚Äôll see a **central table** listing each nation‚Äôs available photovoltaic (PV) datasets. Each country also has its own Markdown file containing detailed information on data sources, data types, and access/usage notes.




## Adding a new country

1. Fork the repo 
2. Update the table
3. Create a .md file based off `COUNTRY_TEMPLATE.md`
4. Submit a PR
